Comparing next_permutation.py ...
Buggy vs Fixed response:
**Analysis:**

Both code snippets aim to find the next lexicographical permutation of a given list. They iterate from right to left, finding the first element `perm[i]` that is smaller than its right neighbor. Then, they find the smallest element `perm[j]` to the right of `i` that is *greater* than `perm[i]` (this is a key difference - snippet 1 incorrectly searches for a *smaller* element). They swap `perm[i]` and `perm[j]`, and reverse the sublist from `i+1` to the end. Snippet 2 correctly implements the algorithm for finding the next permutation, while Snippet 1 has a bug in the inner loop's conditional.

**Similarity Score:** 90.00

**Explanation:** High similarity due to identical structure/logic except for a single, critical bug in the comparison operation within the inner loop.
